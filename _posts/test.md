# Introduction to UoM Assisant (Online Version):

The UoM Assistant is a platform that works as a personal helper for making, arranging and tracking your study plan easier, and avoid any omissions in schedules, assignments or tests. It is consisted of several parts: 


1. Optimized Calender:
   - ENHANCEMENT
    * able to resolve UoM Timetable subscription links and translate it into readable events
    * able to display the number of academic weeks and shift events for different timezones
    * able to display the academic calender
    - SIMPLIFICATION
    * Removed "YEAR" resolution, focus on displaying events by day, week and month

2. Event-Specific Search: 
   You can quick filter out different types of academic events, or search for a specific event.

3. Timeline:
   The assistant will generate a timeline based on your daily academic events and your reminder of unfinished works


4. Event-Specific Reminders:
   The 'reminders' look like tiles which record the name, type, remaining time, progress of your assignments: (such as essays, coursework and assignments)

      You need to manually add your work as an event in the calender. You will provide:
   - Category: is it coursework, or assignment, or essay?
   - Deadline: When should you hand it in?
   - Name: assign a name
   - Progress: the progress of the work: (0, 100, 10)
    Then it will be displayed like a tile which indicate the name, remaining time and progress with two buttons, you can quickly +/- the progress using these buttons.
   
5. Academic Sanity Checker:
   Auto craw Data from SPOT, analyse overall score and attendance rate, warn user when it gets too low

6. Collaborate: 
   Construct Major based deadline together: With verification passed, user can collaborate to the timetable corresponding to their own major, add/modify/delete upcoming courseworks, assignments to it

   User can merge the Collaborated deadline with their own, therefore if they forgot some upcoming assignments, coursework or exam, they can realize it before they really missed them
