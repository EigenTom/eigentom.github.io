## 2. 结构和切图

网页的基本结构如下: 

~~~html
<body>
    <div class="testimonial-container">
        <div class="progress-bar"></div>
        <div class="fas fa-quote-left fa-quote"></div>
        <div class="fas fa-quote-right fa-quote"></div>
        <p class="testimonial">
            I've worked with literally hundreds of HTML/CSS developers and I have to
            say the top spot goes to this guy. This guy is an amazing developer. He
            stresses on good, clean code and pays heed to the details. I love
            developers who respect each and every aspect of a throughly thought out
            design and do their best to put it in code. He goes over and beyond and
            transforms ART into PIXELS - without a glitch, every time.
        </p>
        <div class="user">
            <img src="https://randomuser.me/api/portraits/women/46.jpg" alt="user" class="user-image"/>
            <div class="user-details">
                <h4 class="username">Miyah Myles</h4>
                <p class="role">Marketing</p>
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>
</body>
~~~

<br>

## 3. 编写 `CSS` 样式

完整的 `CSS` 样式表如下:

~~~css
* {
    box-sizing: border-box;
}
body {
    background-color: #f4f4f4;
    font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Open Sans', 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
    align-items: center;
    justify-content: center;
    height: 100vh;
    overflow: hidden;
    margin: 0;
    padding: 10px;
}

.testimonial-container {
    background-color: #476ce4;
    color: #fff;
    border-radius: 15px;
    margin: 20px auto;
    padding: 50px 80px;
    max-width: 768px;
    position: relative;
}
.fa-quote {
    color: rgba(255, 255, 255, .3);
    font-size: 28px;
    position: absolute;
    top: 70px;
}
.fa-quote-right {
    right: 40px;
}
.fa-quote-left {
    left: 40px;
}
.testimonial {
    line-height: 28px;
    text-align: justify;
}

.user {
    display: flex;
    align-items: center;
    
}
.user .user-image {
    border-radius: 50%;
    height: 75px;
    width: 75px;
    object-fit: cover;
    margin-right: 20px;
}
.user .uer-details {
    margin-left: 10px;
}
.user .username {
    margin: 0;
}
.user .role {
    font-weight: normal;
    margin: 10px 0;
}
.progress-bar {
    background-color: #fff;
    height: 4px;
    width: 100%;
    animation: grow 10s linear infinite;
    transform-origin: left;
}

@keyframes grow {
    0% {
        transform: scaleX(0);
    }
}

@media (max-width: 768px) {
    .testimonial-container {
        padding: 20px 30px;
    }
    .fa-quote {
        display: none;
    }
}
~~~

## 4. `JavaScript`

下面编写 `JavaScript` 函数:

~~~javascript
const testimonialsContainer = document.querySelector('.testimonials-container');
const testimonial = document.querySelector('.testimonial');
const userImage = document.querySelector('.user-image');
const username = document.querySelector('.username');
const role = document.querySelector('.role');

const testimonials = [

},
];

let idx = 1;

function updateTestimonial() {
    const {name, position, photo, text} = testimonials[idx];

    testimonial.innerHTML = text;
    userImage.src = photo;
    username.innerHTML = name;
    role.innerHTML = position;

    idx++;

    if (idx > testimonials.length-1) {
        idx = 0;
    }
}
setInterval(updateTestimonial, 10000);
