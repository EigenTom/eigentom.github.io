**Definition: (Combinatorial Optimization)**
> View an combinatorial problem as $(R, C)$, where $R$ is a finite set of combinatorial configurations given in an implicit way.
> 
> $C$: Cost function which maps from a combinatorial configuration to a real number (Cost).
>
> Then we model the combinatorial optimization problem as finding the configuration with the minimal cost.
