I"ö<p>Hi, I am <em>@huxpro</em> (Huang, Xuan), an UI/Frontend engineer &amp; designer, accidentally growing into a compiler hacker. My current interests range from programming languages theory and implementation in general (compiler, type system, type-based formal verification, virtual machine, runtime systems, garbage collection) to software engineering in the tech industry (client-side web/mobile app development, server-side backend, user interface and UX, developer infrastructure and DX).</p>

<p>Iâ€™m currently working on the <a href="https://hermesengine.dev/">Hermes JavaScript Engine</a> at <a href="http://facebook.com/">Facebook</a>. I was also involved in some of the <a href="https://tech.fb.com/ar-vr/">Facebook Reality Labs</a> and the <a href="https://reasonml.github.io/">ReasonML</a> (now <a href="https://rescript-lang.org/">ReScript</a>) efforts. Iâ€™m also passionated about <a href="https://reactjs.org/">React</a> and <a href="https://reactnative.dev/">React Native</a>.</p>

<p>In the past, I worked on <a href="https://www.alitrip.com/">Alitrip (Fliggy)</a> mobile and web apps under the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alibaba_Group">Alibaba Group</a>, found and lead front-end infrastructure team at an unicorn startup company <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/beijing-weiying-technology">Beijing Weiying (a.k.a. WePiao, now acquired by Maoyan)</a>, and helped <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ele.me">Ele.me (now acquired by Alibaba)</a> to upgrade their mobile web site into <a href="https://medium.com/elemefe/upgrading-ele-me-to-progressive-web-app-2a446832e509">the first influential PWA (progressive web app) in China</a>.</p>

<p>I studied BA, Digital Media Art at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication_University_of_China">Communication University of China</a> and MS, Computer Science (with a focus on programming languages) at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rochester_Institute_of_Technology">Rochester Institute of Technology</a>.</p>

<h5 id="my-pl-spectrum-wip-"><a href="https://huangxuan.me/2020/05/05/pl-chart/">My PL Spectrum (WIP ðŸš§)</a></h5>

<p>I made a chart to visualize my experiences and interests on some of the programming languages. I know. I know this is always contraversial. But itâ€™s just something quite self-entertaining to do. So bare with me and have fun reading that!</p>
